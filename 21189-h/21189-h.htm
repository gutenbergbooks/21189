<div class="ml">
<p><span class="smcap">A wolf</span> there was, whose scanty fare</p>
<p>Had made his person lean and spare;</p>
<p>A dog there was, so amply fed,</p>
<p>His sides were plump and sleek; 'tis said</p>
<p>The wolf once met this prosp'rous cur,</p>
<p>And thus began: "Your servant, sir;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>I'm pleased to see you look so well,</p>
<p>Though how it is I cannot tell;</p>
<p>I have not broke my fast to-day;</p>
<p>Nor have I, I'm concern'd to say,</p>
<p>One bone in store or expectation,</p>
<p class="b">And that I call a great vexation."</p>

<p>"Indeed it is," the dog replied:</p>
<p>"I know no ill so great beside;</p>
<p>But if you do not like to be</p>
<p>So poorly fed, come live with me."</p>
<p>"Agreed," rejoined the wolf, "I'll go:</p>
<p>But pray, what work am I to do?"</p>
<p>"Oh, guard the house, and do not fail</p>
<p class="b">To bark at thieves, and wag your tail."</p>

<p>So off they jogg'd, and soon arrived</p>
<p>At where the friendly mastiff lived.</p>
<p>"Well," said the wolf, "I can't deny</p>
<p>You have a better house than I."</p>
<p>"Not so," the other then replied,</p>
<p>"If you with me will hence abide."</p>
<p>"Oh," said the wolf, "how kind you are!</p>
<p>But what d'ye call <i>that</i>, hanging there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Is it an iron chain, or what?"</p>
<p>"Friend," said the dog, "I quite forgot</p>
<p>To mention that; sometimes, you see,</p>
<p>They hook that little chain to <i>me</i>;</p>
<p>But it is only meant to keep</p>
<p>Us dogs from walking in our sleep,</p>
<p>And should you wear it, you would find,</p>
<p class="b">It's nothing that you need to mind."</p>

<p>"I'll take your word," the wolf replied.</p>
<p>"It's truth by me shall ne'er be tried;</p>
<p>I'll have my liberty again,</p>
<p>And you your collar and your chain."</p>

<p>What he had to expect," said the herdsman, "I trow;</p>
<p class="b">But I've thought of a scheme that will trouble you now."</p>

<p>So what did he do, sir, but put up a board,</p>
<p>Describing the thief, and proposed a reward</p>
<p>Of a lamb, to the man who would give information</p>
<p class="b">Concerning the thief, and his true designation.</p>

<p>The project succeeded; for soon there applied</p>
<p>A certain near neighbor, with others beside.</p>
<p>"But tell me the thief," said the herdsman, "at least;"</p>
<p class="b">"Come hither," said they, "and we'll show you the beast!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>"The <i>beast</i>!" said the rustic, who thought he should die on</p>

<p>"Ill luck to my hurry, what now shall I do?</p>

<div class="ml">
<p>"<span class="smcap">I certainly</span> think," said a fox to a crane,</p>
<p>"That face, ma'am of yours is remarkably plain;</p>
<p>That beak that you wear is so frightful a feature,</p>
<p>It makes you appear a most singular creature."</p>
<p>The crane, much offended at what she had heard,</p>
<p>March'd off at full speed, without saying a word:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>"Oh dear!" said the fox, "Mrs. Crane, I protest</p>
<p>You misunderstand me, 'twas only a jest."</p>
<p>"Come, don't be affronted&mdash;stay with me and dine;</p>
<p>You know very well 'tis this temper of mine</p>
<p>To say such odd things to my intimate friends;</p>
<p>But you know that poor Reynard no mischief intends."</p>
<p>So the crane thought it best not to break with him quite,</p>
<p>But to view his remarks in a good-natured light.</p>
<p>So she put on as pleasant a face as she could</p>
<p>When he ask'd her to dine, and replied that she would.</p>
<p>But alas! she perceived that his jokes were not over,</p>
<p>When Reynard removed from the victuals its cover</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>'Twas neither game, butcher's meat, chicken, not fish;</p>
<p>But plain gravy-soup, in a broad shallow dish.</p>
<p>Now this the fox lapp'd with his tongue very quick,</p>
<p>While the crane could scarce dip in the point of her beak;</p>
<p>"You make a poor dinner," said he to his guest;</p>
<p>"Oh, dear! by no means," said the bird, "I protest."</p>
<p>But the crane ask'd the fox on a subsequent day,</p>
<p>When nothing, it seems, for their dinner had they</p>
<p>But some minced meat served up in a narrow-neck'd jar;</p>
<p>Too long, and narrow, for Reynard by far.</p>
<p>"You make a poor dinner, I fear," said the bird;</p>
<p>"Why, I think," said the fox, "'twould be very absurd</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>To deny what you say, yet I cannot complain,</p>

<p>Cold and hungry, tired and wet,</p>

<p>"What?" said his host, in accent rough,</p>
<p>"Is not your pottage hot enough?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the man, "full well I know it,</p>
<p>'Tis far too hot, that's why I blow it."</p>

<div class="ml">
<p><span class="smcap">Said</span> a hare to a tortoise, "Good sir, what a while</p>
<p class="indent">You have been only crossing the way;</p>
<p>Why I really believe that to go half a mile,</p>
<p class="b indent">You must travel two nights and a day."</p>

<p>"I am very contented," the creature replied,</p>
<p class="indent">"Though I walk but a tortoise's pace,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>But if you think proper the point to decide,</p>
<p class="b indent">We will run half a mile in a race."</p>

<p>"Very good," said the hare; said the tortoise, "Proceed,</p>
<p class="indent">And the fox shall decide who has won,"</p>
<p>Then the hare started off with incredible speed;</p>
<p class="b indent">But the tortoise walk'd leisurely on.</p>

<p>"Come tortoise, friend tortoise, walk on," said the hare,</p>
<p class="indent">"Well, I shall stay here for my dinner;</p>
<p>Why, 'twill take you a month, at that rate, to get there,</p>
<p class="b indent">Then how can you hope to be winner?"</p>

<p>But the tortoise could hear not a word that she said</p>
<p class="indent">For he was far distant behind;</p>
<p>So the hare felt secured while at leisure she fed,</p>
<p class="b indent">And took a sound nap when she dined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>So at last this slow walker came up with the hare,</p>
<p class="indent">And there fast asleep did he spy her;</p>
<p>And he cunningly crept with such caution and care,</p>
<p class="b indent">That she woke not, although he pass'd by her.</p>

<p>"Well now," thought the hare, when she open'd her eyes,</p>
<p class="indent">"For the race,&mdash;and I soon shall have done it;"</p>

<p class="b">One hundred good eggs, or fourscore to be sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>"Well then&mdash;stop a bit,&mdash;it must not be forgotten,</p>
<p>Some of these may be broken, and some may be rotten;</p>
<p>But if twenty for accidents should be detach'd,</p>
<p class="b">It will leave me just sixty sound eggs to hatch'd.</p>

<p>"Well, sixty sound eggs&mdash;no; sound chickens, I mean;</p>
<p>Of these some may die&mdash;we'll suppose seventeen&mdash;</p>
<p>Seventeen!&mdash;not so many&mdash;say ten at the most,</p>

<p>Why they take but one grain at a time when they feed,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>So that's a mere trifle; now then let us see,</p>

<p>"Six shillings a pair&mdash;five&mdash;four&mdash;three-and-six,</p>
<p>To prevent all mistakes, that low price I will fix;</p>
<p>Now what will that make? fifty chickens, I said,</p>
<p class="b">Fifty times three-and-sixpence&mdash;<i>I'll ask brother Ned</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh! but stop&mdash;three-and-sixpence a <i>pair</i> I must sell 'em;</p>
<p>Well, a pair is a couple&mdash;now then let us tell 'em;</p>
<p>A couple in fifty will go&mdash;(my poor brain!)</p>
<p class="b">Why just a score times, and five pair will remain.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five pair of fowls&mdash;now how shameful it is,</p>
<p>That I can't reckon up as much money as this!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Well, there's no use in trying; so let's give a guess;</p>
<p class="b">I will say twenty pounds, and <i>it can't be no less</i>.</p>

<p>"Twenty pounds, I am certain, will buy me a cow,</p>
<p>Thirty geese, and two turkeys&mdash;eight pigs and a sow;</p>
<p>Now if these turn out well, at the end of the year,</p>
<p class="b">I shall fill both my pockets with guineas 'tis clear.</p>

<p>"Then I'll bid that old tumble-down hovel good-bye;</p>
<p>My mother she'll scold, and my sisters they'll cry:</p>

<p>Afraid they would her nest descry,</p>
<p>Before her tender brood could fly.</p>
<p>She charged them therefore every day,</p>
<p>Before for food she flew away,</p>
<p>To watch the farmer in her stead,</p>
<p class="b">And listen well to all he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>It chanced one day, she scarce was gone,</p>
<p>Ere the farmer came and his son.</p>
<p>The farmer well his field survey'd,</p>
<p>And sundry observations made;</p>
<p>At last, "I'll tell you what," said he,</p>
<p>"This corn is fit to cut, I see;</p>
<p>But we our neighbor's help must borrow,</p>
<p class="b">So tell them we begin to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Ah! dearest mother," then, said they,</p>
<p class="b">"Pray, let us all begone to-day."</p>

<p>"My dears," said she, "you need not fret,</p>
<p>I shall not be uneasy yet;</p>
<p>For if he waits for neighbor's aid,</p>
<p class="b">The business long will be delay'd."</p>

<p>At dawn she left her nest once more,</p>
<p class="b">And charged her young ones as before.</p>

<p>At five the farmer came again,</p>
<p>And waited for his friends in vain,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>"Well," said the man, "I fancy, son,</p>
<p>These <i>friends</i> we can't depend upon;</p>
<p>To-morrow early, mind you go,</p>
<p class="b">And let our own <i>relations</i> know."</p>

<p>Again the lark approach'd her nest,</p>
<p>When round her all her young ones press'd,</p>
<p>And told their mother, word for word,</p>
<p class="b">The fresh intelligence they heard.</p>

<p>"Ah, children, be at ease," said she</p>
<p>"We're safe another day, I see;</p>
<p>For these <i>relations</i>, you will find,</p>
<p class="b">Just like his <i>friends</i>, will stay behind."</p>

<p>At dawn again the lark withdrew,</p>
<p class="b">And did again her charge renew.</p>

<p>Once more the farmer early came,</p>
<p>And found the case was just the same.</p>
<p>The day advanced, the sun was high;</p>
<p>But not a single help drew nigh.</p>
<p>Then said the farmer, "Hark ye, son&mdash;</p>
<p>I see this job will not be done,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>While thus we wait for friends and neighbors;</p>
<p>So you and I'll commence our labors:</p>
<p>To-morrow early, we'll begin</p>
<p class="b"><i>Ourselves</i>, and get our harvest in."</p>

<p>"Now," said the lark, when this she heard,</p>
<p>"Our movement must not be deferr'd;</p>
<p>For if the farmer and his son</p>
<p class="b">Themselves begin, 'twill soon be done."</p>

<p>Now though the wolf came there to <i>drink</i>,</p>

<p>As soon as near the lamb he came,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>Yet thought it better to begin,</p>
<p class="b">With threat'ning words and angry mien.</p>

<p>"And so," said he, to him below,</p>
<p>"How dare you stir the water so?</p>
<p>Making the cool refreshing flood,</p>
<p class="b">As brown as beer, and thick as mud."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the lamb, "that cannot be,</p>
<p>The water flows <i>from you to me</i>;</p>
<p>So, 'tis impossible, I think,</p>
<p class="b">That what I do can spoil your drink."</p>

<p>"I say it does, you saucy puss:</p>
<p>How dare you contradict me thus;</p>
<p>But more than this, you idle clack,</p>
<p>You rail'd at me behind my back</p>
<p>Two years ago, I have been told;"</p>
<p>"How so? I'm not a twelvemonth old,"</p>
<p>The lamb replied; "So I suspect</p>
<p class="b">Your honor is not quite correct."</p>

<p>"If not, your mother it must be,</p>
<p>And that comes all the same to me,"</p>

<p>The man roared&mdash;the guests laugh'd&mdash;the dog bark'd&mdash;the bell rung:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Some beans, and if I'm not mistaken,</p>

<h2><a href="#contents">THE EPICURE AND THE PHYSICIAN.</a></h2>

<div class="ml">
<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> hundred years ago, or more,</p>
<p>An heir possess'd a miser's store;</p>
<p>Rejoiced to find his father dead,</p>
<p>Till then on thrifty viands fed;</p>
<p>Unnumber'd dishes crown'd his board,</p>
<p>With each unwholesome trifle stored.</p>
<p>He ate&mdash;and long'd to eat again,</p>
<p>But sigh'd for appetite in vain:</p>
<p>His food, though dress'd a thousand ways,</p>
<p>Had lost its late accustom'd praise;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>He relish'd nothing&mdash;sickly grew&mdash;</p>
<p>Yet long'd to taste of something new.</p>
<p>It chanced in this disastrous case,</p>
<p>One morn betimes he join'd the chase:</p>
<p>Swift o'er the plain the hunters fly,</p>
<p>Each echoing out a joyous cry;</p>
<p>A forest next before them lay;</p>
<p>He, left behind, mistook his way,</p>
<p>And long alone bewildered rode,</p>
<p>He found a peasant's poor abode;</p>
<p>But fasting kept, from six to four,</p>
<p>Felt hunger, long unfelt before;</p>
<p>The friendly swain this want supplied,</p>
<p>And Joan some eggs and bacon fried.</p>
<p>Not dainty now, the squire in haste</p>
<p>Fell to, and praised their savory taste;</p>
<p>Nay, said his meal had such a <i>gout</i></p>
<p>He ne'er in tarts and olios knew.</p>
<p>Rejoiced to think he'd found a dish,</p>
<p>That crown'd his long unanswer'd wish,</p>
<p>With gold his thankful host he paid,</p>
<p>Who guides him back from whence he stray'd;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>But ere they part, so well he dined,</p>
<p>His rustic host the squire enjoin'd</p>
<p>To send him home next day a stock</p>
<p>Of those same eggs and charming hock.</p>
<p>He hoped this dish of savory meat</p>
<p>Would prove that still 'twas bliss to eat;</p>
<p>But, ah! he found, like all the rest,</p>
<p>These eggs were tasteless things at best;</p>
<p>The bacon not a dog would touch,</p>
<p>So rank&mdash;he never tasted such!</p>
<p>He sent express to fetch the clown,</p>
<p>And thus address'd him with a frown:</p>
<p>"These eggs, this bacon, that you sent,</p>
<p>For Christian food were never meant;</p>
<p>As soon I'll think the moon's a cheese,</p>
<p>As those you dress'd the same with these.</p>
<p>Little I thought"&mdash;"Sir," says the peasant,</p>
<p>"I'm glad your worship is so pleasant:</p>
<p>You joke, I'm sure: for I can swear,</p>
<p>The same the fowls that laid them are!</p>
<p>And know as well that all the bacon</p>
<p>From one the self-same flitch was taken:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>The air, indeed, about our green</p>
<p>Is known to make the stomach keen."</p>
<p>"Is that the case?" the squire replied;</p>
<p>"That air shall be directly tried."</p>
<p>He gave command&mdash;a house he hired,</p>
<p>And down he goes with hope inspired,</p>
<p>And takes his cooks&mdash;a favorite train;</p>
<p>But still they ply their art in vain.</p>
<p>Perhaps 'twas riding did the feat:</p>
<p>He rides,&mdash;but still he cannot eat.</p>
<p>At last a friend, to physic bred,</p>
<p>Perceived his case, and thus he said:</p>
<p>"Be ruled by me, you soon shall eat,</p>
<p>With hearty gust, the plainest meat;</p>
<p>A pint of milk each rising morn,</p>
<p>Procure from cow of sable horn;</p>
<p>Shake in three drops of morning dew</p>
<p>From twig of ever-verdant yew;</p>
<p>It must by your own hand be done,</p>
<p>Your face turn'd westward from the sun.</p>
<p>With this, ere half an hour is past,</p>
<p>Well crumb'd with biscuit, break your fast;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>Which done, from food (or all is vain)</p>
<p>For twice three hours and one abstain&mdash;</p>
<p>Then dine on one substantial dish,</p>
<p>If plainly dress'd, of flesh or fish."</p>
<p>Grave look'd the doctor as he spake&mdash;</p>
<p>The squire concludes th' advice to take,</p>
<p>And, cheated into temperance, found</p>
<p>The bliss his former luxury drown'd.</p>

<p>In Rome there dwelt, in days of yore,</p>

<p>Now it was a cock of which our little mouse,</p>

<p>That you're the noisiest of the three?</p>
<p>That sheep says not a word,</p>

<p>"But," said the hog, "they both are fools.</p>

<p>They'd halloo out at greater rate,</p>
